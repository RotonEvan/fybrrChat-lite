# fybrrChat-lite
The demand for connecting with others and sharing messages and multimedia files is ever growing but peopleâ€™s lack of trust on a centralized system makes the system unusable for extremely critical and sensitive use cases such as military and government operations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a system which ensures impenetrable security embedded into the methodology used for communication between peers. Therefore, we propose a decentralized secure chat application based on trustless network architecture, which avoids any central authority or organisation from exploiting users by accessing their private data or manipulating the user-end policies. We also implement end-to-end encryption for secure transfer of messages between peers. To enforce a critical policy change, in the absence of a central authority, we provide a Consensus mechanism where peers in the network vote for the particular policy change within a private or public swarm.
