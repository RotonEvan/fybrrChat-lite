# fybrrChat-lite
The demand for connecting with others and sharingmessages and multimedia files is ever growing but peopleâ€™s lackof  trust  on  a  centralized  system  makes  the  system  unusable  forextremely  critical  and  sensitive  use  cases  such  as  military  andgovernment operations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for asystem  which  ensures  impenetrable  security  embedded  into  themethodology used for communication between peers. Therefore,we  propose  a  decentralized  secure  chat  application  based  ontrustlessnetwork architecture, which avoids any central authorityor  organisation  from  exploiting  users  by  accessing  their  privatedata  or  manipulating  the  user-end  policies.  We  also  implementend-to-end  encryption  for  secure  transfer  of  messages  betweenpeers.  To  enforce  a  critical  policy  change,  in  the  absence  of  acentral  authority,  we  provide  a  Consensus  mechanism  wherepeers in the network vote for the particular policy change withina  private  or  public  swarm.
